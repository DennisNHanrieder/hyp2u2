# Class Integration Demo

## Overview  
**PHP OOP Class Integration Demo** is a small-scale PHP project showcasing **object-oriented programming** concepts.  
It loads and uses multiple custom classes, demonstrating object creation, property access, and method calls in a structured way.

## Why this project exists  
The project was built to:  
- Practice **class-based architecture** in PHP.  
- Demonstrate loading and reusing multiple class files in a single application.  
- Show **OOP principles** like encapsulation, modularity, and reusability.  

## Features  
- **Multiple Classes** — Organized under a dedicated `HYP2UE02` folder.  
- **Object Creation & Usage** — Instantiate and interact with class properties/methods.  
- **Modular File Structure** — Separates business logic from the main entry file.  
- **Extensible** — Easy to add new classes and functionality.  

## Technologies used  
- **Backend:** PHP 8+  
- **OOP Principles:** Class creation, properties, methods, and object interaction.  

## How to run the project  
```bash
# 1) Place the project in your PHP environment (e.g., XAMPP, Laragon, MAMP)
# Example:
# /htdocs/php-oop-demo

# 2) Start your PHP server
php -S localhost:8000

# 3) Open in a browser
http://localhost:8000/index.php
```

## Dependencies & requirements  
- PHP 8+  
- Local development server (XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, or PHP built-in server)  

## How to contribute  
1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes.  
2. Add new classes inside the `HYP2UE02` folder.  
3. Update `index.php` to use your new classes.  
4. Submit a pull request with your changes and a description.  

## What powers the core functionality?  
- **PHP OOP** — Class definitions, instantiation, and method calls.  
- **Modular file structure** — Easy-to-maintain architecture.
